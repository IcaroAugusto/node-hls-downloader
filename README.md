async function main() {
  var downloader = new HLSDownloader({
    url: 'm3u8 url',
    file: 'ts file',
    headers: 'request headers', //look at the code for defaults
    maxRes: 1200, //maximum resolution (video height)
    minRes: 0, //minimum resolution (video height)
    sorting: 'best', //best or worst, how to select playlists
    retries: 3, //how many times to retry when request fails or returns empty playlist/segments
    retryDelay: 2000, //ms to wait between each retry attempt
  });
  setTimeout(() => downloader.stop(), 30000);
